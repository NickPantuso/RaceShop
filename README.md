# RaceShop

This is a website that lets you 'shop' for race cars online. There's a product page that lets you view all cars in stock, and you can select the amount you'd like to buy. There is a fully-functioning cart system that lets you add and delete things from your cart, and when you 'place order' it clears your cart and starts you over. In order to buy these cars you first have to log into the race shop, and if you don't have a log in, you can create one.
