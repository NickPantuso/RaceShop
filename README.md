# RaceShop

http://pantusoportoflio.byethost32.com/catalog

A website that lets you 'shop' for race cars online. Features a product page where you can view and learn about all cars in stock. Also has a fully-functioning cart system that lets you add, delete, and purchase things from your cart. In order to 'buy' these cars you first have to log into the race shop, and if you don't have a log in, you can create one.

UPDATE: All text boxes and tables stay within their div and don't overflow on small screens/windows anymore.
