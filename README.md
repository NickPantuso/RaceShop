# RaceShop

http://pantuso.byethost7.com/catalog

A website that lets you 'shop' for race cars online. Features a product page that lets you view all cars in stock, and you can select the amount you'd like to buy. Also has a fully-functioning cart system that lets you add and delete things from your cart; when you place an order it clears your cart and starts you over. In order to buy these cars you first have to log into the race shop, and if you don't have a log in, you can create one.

# What was learned?

* Transferring code to a host to create a public website
* PHP and a variety of its tools
* Creating and connecting to a database
* Improved code organization
* A few CSS and Javascript elements

Note: The course in which I completed this did not teach CSS, and I was unaware of the recommended prerequisite where CSS is taught. The CSS in this project is rough, and some of the lines of code may be unnecessary. If you use a phone to view the website, it's likely that things will not look right and text will be overflowing out of their desired boxes. However, everything looks perfect on any normal computer screen.
