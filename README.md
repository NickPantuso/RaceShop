# RaceShop

http://pantusoportoflio.byethost32.com/catalog

A website that lets you 'shop' for race cars online. Features a product page where you can view and learn about all cars in stock. Also has a fully-functioning cart system that lets you add, delete, and purchase things from your cart. In order to 'buy' these cars you first have to log into the race shop, and if you don't have a log in, you can create one.

UPDATE: All text boxes and tables stay within their div and don't overflow anymore.

# What was learned?
* Transferring code to a host to create a public website
* PHP and a variety of its tools
* Connecting to and creating a database
* Improved code organization
* A few CSS and Javascript elements

# What can be improved?
* The CSS in the RaceShop Products page is awkward. Image cells are too big and text cells are too small/crunched.
* The website feels empty; pages could be combined, or more content could be added.
* The website is difficult to use on tiny screens, such as iPhones.

Note: Google or other browsers may tell you the site is deceptive or dangerous, it's not.
